# **Kosmósinn**  
**Spjallborð alþýðunnar**

Kosmósinn is a bulletin board website

We require a large and vibrant userbase which views this website as its default

We can monetize the website through:
* frivolous cosmetics for donators (e.g. avatars, colored name, etc)
* users can award others for their contributions (e.g. reddit gold)
* general e-begging (we say its for server costs)

## 1 The Vision and Scope document

### 1.1 Vision Statement
**For** people  
**who** want to meet new people and start a conversation about their interests.  
**The** *Kosmósinn* is a social platform/forum.  
**that** makes it easy to find friends who share common interests.  
**Unlike** *Hugi*   
**our product** will give everyone a platform express their views, share common interests and have conversations with people around the world.  

### 1.2 Background
Our product comes from the idea of the easy to use and generally non-cosmetic forums of old. Unlike successful platforms that have sprouted up in recent years our idea is to create a forum like social platform without a special news feed so as to not clutter the view with irrelevant information to the user.

### 1.3 Major features
Major features include a sign up and login process and a way for users to customise their profile. Creating, reading, updating and deleting of posts and commenting in threads. Message sending and recieving to/from other users on the platform. Veiwing of post history of other users. Upvoting and downvoting content through the click of a button. Last but not least, creating of communities or groups.

## 2 The Initial Use Case Document

### 2.1 Use Case 1

His close group of friends shows little interest in his hobby though and it is getting hard to get a reaction out of them other than "that looks good". Enter Kosmósinn, the teen finds a community on Viktor full of miniature plane enthusiasts sharing their creations with eachother and recieving constructive feedback and criticism. After logging in the teen can post pictures, recieve comments and feedback in threads.

### 2.2 Use Case 2
A man is surfing Kosmósinn and sees a post he doesn't agree with. He logs into the website with username and password. Then he presses the downvote button next to the post to express his opinion of the post.
