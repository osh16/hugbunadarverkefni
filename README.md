Viktor is a bulletin board website

Major features include:
* sign up and log in
* create, read, update and delete threads/comments
* send messages to other users
* view post history of other users
* upvote/downvote content
* create your own communities (maybe)

We require a large and vibrant userbase which views this website as its default

We can monetize the website through:
* frivolous cosmetics for donators (e.g. avatars, colored name, etc)
* users can award others for their contributions (e.g. reddit gold)
* general e-begging (we say its for server costs)
