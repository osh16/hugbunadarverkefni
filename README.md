Kosmósinn is a bulletin board website

We require a large and vibrant userbase which views this website as its default

We can monetize the website through:
* frivolous cosmetics for donators (e.g. avatars, colored name, etc)
* users can award others for their contributions (e.g. reddit gold)
* general e-begging (we say its for server costs)

# Usage

To run:

	$ Kosmosinn/mvnw spring-boot:run

In development process, to compile:

	Kosmosinn/mvn compile
